# Neural Network for Magic Card Names
Data taken from  mtgjson.com

This was a experiment to see if I could generate new Magic Card Names using neural networks. I got my inspiration from this Article from colin morris https://colinmorris.github.io/blog/dreaming-rbms

However, I am using sklearn to train my network, which only uses the CPU and makes the hole thing kinda slow. Therefore, I suggest using subsets of the magic Cards, such as Creature Types like Dinosaurs or Humans to get a smaller sample size.
